The easiest way to play a few hands against UZHoldem is by using Poker Academy. After downloading and installing Poker Academy, the necessary files (found in uzholden-dist.zip) have to be added to the program folder of Poker Academy.

Figure \ref{fig:file-location}Êshows the required location of the files in the application package in Mac OS X. On Windows, the steps are similar, when copying all the files into the \texttt{data/bots}Ê directory.

Although its possible to use UZHoldem with the standard settings, I recommend starting PokerAcademy with a JVM that has 512MB or even 1GB memory available. On Windows, this can by done by starting Poker Academy with the switch \texttt{-JXmx512}, on Mac OSX, this requires changing the \texttt{Info.plist} file in the application package (key \texttt{VMOptions}).

 After copying the files, the only additional step required is adding a new player based on the agent (figure \ref{fig:opponent-manager})

As a final step, the opponent can now be placed on a new poker table.
