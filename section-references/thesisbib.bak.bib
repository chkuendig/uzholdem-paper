The authors discuss the requirements of learning for\newline generalization, which is NP-complete and cannot be approached\newline by traditional methods based on gradient descent. They present\newline a stochastic learning algorithm based on simulated annealing in\newline weight space. The convergence properties and feasibility of the\newline algorithm are verified},

@inproceedings{Davidson2000,
	Abstract = {The game of poker has many properties that make it an interesting topic for articial intelligence (AI). It is a game of imperfect information, which relates to one of the most fundamental problems in computer science: how to handle knowledge that may be erroneous or incomplete. Poker is also one of the few games to be studied where deriving an accurate understanding of each opponent's style is an essential element to success. In developing a strong poker program, the opponent modeling method has always been a central component of the system. As other aspects of the program were improved, the techniques for modeling once again became a limiting factor to the overall level of play. As a result, the topic has been revisited. This paper reports on recent progress achieved by improved statistical methods, which were suggested by experiments using articial neural networks.},

Although the program plays reasonably well, it is oblivious\newline to the opponent{\^A}'s weaknesses and biases. Modeling the opponent to exploit predictability is critical to success at poker.\newline This paper introduces Vexbot, a program that uses a game-tree search algorithm to compute the expected value of each betting option, and does real-time\newline opponent modeling to improve its evaluation function estimates. The result is a program that defeats PsOpti convincingly, and poses a much tougher challenge for strong human players.},

The new algorithm, named ID5R, lets one apply the ID3 induction process to learning tasks in which training instances are presented serially. Although the basic tree-building algorithms differ only in how the decision trees are constructed, experiments show that incremental training makes it possible to select training instances more carefully, which can result in smaller decision trees. The ID3 algorithm and its variants are compared in terms of theoretical complexity and empirical behavior.},

	Abstract = {Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;Uncertainty in poker stems from two key sources, the shuffled deck and an adversary whose strategy is unknown. One approach\newline to playing poker is to find a pessimistic game-theoretic solution (i.e., a Nash equilibrium), but human players have idiosyncratic\newline weaknesses that can be exploited if some model or counter-strategy can be learned by observing their play. However, games\newline against humans last for at most a few hundred hands, so learning must be very fast to be useful. We explore two approaches\newline to opponent modelling in the context of Kuhn poker, a small game for which game-theoretic solutions are known. Parameter estimation\newline and expert algorithms are both studied. Experiments demonstrate that, even in this small game, convergence to maximally exploitive\newline solutions in a small number of hands is impractical, but that good (e.g., better than Nash) performance can be achieved in\newline as few as 50 hands. Finally, we show},

	Abstract = {Poker is an interesting test-bed for artificial intelligence research. It is a game of imperfect knowledge, where multiple competing agents must deal with risk management, opponent modeling, unreliable information, and deception, much like decision-making applications in the real world. Opponent modeling is one of the most difficult problems in decision-making applications and in poker it is essential to achieving high performance. This chapter describes and evaluates the implicit and explicit learning in the poker program LOKI. LOKI implicitly ''learns'' sophisticated strategies by selectively sampling likely cards for the opponents and then simulating the remainder of the game. The program has explicit learning by observing its opponents, constructing opponent models and dynamically adapting its play to exploit patterns in the opponents' play. The result is a program capable of playing reasonably strong poker, but there remains considerable research to be done to play at a world-clas},

	Abstract = {We present a computational approach to the saddle-point formulation for the Nash equilibria of two-person, zero-sum sequential\newline games of imperfect information. The algorithm is a first-order gradient method based on modern smoothing techniques for non-smooth\newline convex optimization. The algorithm requires O(1/e) iterations to compute an e-equilibrium, and the work per iteration is extremely low. These features enable us to find approximate Nash equilibria for\newline sequential games with a tree representation of about 1010 nodes. This is three orders of magnitude larger than what previous algorithms can handle. We present two heuristic improvements\newline to the basic algorithm and demonstrate their efficacy on a range of real-world games. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the\newline algorithm can be customized to a specific class of problems with enormous memory savings.},
