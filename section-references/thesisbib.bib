	Abstract = {Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;Uncertainty in poker stems from two key sources, the shuffled deck and an adversary whose strategy is unknown. One approach\newline to playing poker is to find a pessimistic game-theoretic solution (i.e., a Nash equilibrium), but human players have idiosyncratic\newline weaknesses that can be exploited if some model or counter-strategy can be learned by observing their play. However, games\newline against humans last for at most a few hundred hands, so learning must be very fast to be useful. We explore two approaches\newline to opponent modelling in the context of Kuhn poker, a small game for which game-theoretic solutions are known. Parameter estimation\newline and expert algorithms are both studied. Experiments demonstrate that, even in this small game, convergence to maximally exploitive\newline solutions in a small number of hands is impractical, but that good (e.g., better than Nash) performance can be achieved in\newline as few as 50 hands. Finally, we show},

@article{Billings2001,

title = {Learning to play strong poker},
abstract = {Poker is an interesting test-bed for artificial intelligence research. It is a game of imperfect knowledge, where multiple competing agents must deal with risk management, opponent modeling, unreliable information, and deception, much like decision-making applications in the real world. Opponent modeling is one of the most difficult problems in decision-making applications and in poker it is essential to achieving high performance. This chapter describes and evaluates the implicit and explicit learning in the poker program LOKI. LOKI implicitly ''learns'' sophisticated strategies by selectively sampling likely cards for the opponents and then simulating the remainder of the game. The program has explicit learning by observing its opponents, constructing opponent models and dynamically adapting its play to exploit patterns in the opponents' play. The result is a program capable of playing reasonably strong poker, but there remains considerable research to be done to play at a world-clas},

The new algorithm, named ID5R, lets one apply the ID3 induction process to learning tasks in which training instances are presented serially. Although the basic tree-building algorithms differ only in how the decision trees are constructed, experiments show that incremental training makes it possible to select training instances more carefully, which can result in smaller decision trees. The ID3 algorithm and its variants are compared in terms of theoretical complexity and empirical behavior.},
